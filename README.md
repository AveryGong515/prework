# Prework - HelloWorld

Submitted by: Avery Xinran Gong

HelloWorld is my first intro to building an app using Swift. This very simple app contains a brief introduction of myself and a fun little button "Admit Me" that changes the background color and represents my hope of being admitted to ios101 :) 

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I chose the wrong interface at first and was confused by a lot of the instructions because the tool bar menu was different, but overall it was very straightforward.
