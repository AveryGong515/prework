# Prework - SaveTheBite

Submitted by: Avery Xinran Gong

SaveTheBite is my first intro to building an app using Swift. This very simple app contains a brief introduction of myself and a fun little button "Admit Me" that changes the background color and represents my hope of being admitted to ios101 :) 

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [Done] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [Done] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4) 
Some of my favorite apps:
Wechat
- Ability to recall messages within 2 minutes
- Feature for grouping friends into different categories and giving them different access to your posts

Spotify
- Recommends songs that match my taste of music
- Start-a-Jam feature that allows user to listen to music together

Outlook
- Schedule-send feature to preset email send time
- Calendar feature that automatically sends reminder for upcoming events

Some ideas for an app I want to build:
I have been wanting to build a grocery inventory tracking app for a while now. Grocery waste is a huge problem in the United States, and a primary cause of this problem is lack of organization in grocery shopping and impulse purchases. Many times, I found myself buying food that I already have in the fridge unknowingly, which oftentimes lead to spoiled food and spending money on unnecessary items. To help myself and many others that struggle with grocery waste, I want to implement a tool that not only has a shopping list, but also keep track of an inventory list with item availability at home and their expiry dates. When an item runs out, it will be deleted from the inventory and added to the shopping list (or not if the user chooses not to). The user will get push notification to remind them of items near or past expiration. To make entering items easier, I would like to implement a feature that allows users to scan the barcode of items similar to in a grocery shop, and the item name will be automatically entered into the system. Gamification is also an interesting idea I want to explore - making the user experience rewardable through tracking their progress in being sustainable and wasting less groceries.















## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I chose the wrong interface at first and was confused by a lot of the instructions because the tool bar menu was different, but overall it was very straightforward.
